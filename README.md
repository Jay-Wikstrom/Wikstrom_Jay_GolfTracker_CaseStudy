# Golf Tracker


# Overview

This application uses spring security to allow new users to create an account
and allows already register users to log in to their accounts. Once a user
creates an account they can then track all their past golf scores.  The user
can also give a rating from 1-10 at all the golf courses they. The home page
will keep track of how many courses the user has played at and will tell them
how many courses they have rated.
